With slight fear in my heart, curiousity in my mind, and unplanned springbreak...I set about finding what I could about various blogging platforms. Mostly as a quest to find out what if I could quickly and in a pain-free and free way set up and host a simple static site.

## Journey

I came across static site generatores a while back and I found myself curious to try one but lacking the time or serious motivation to actually do something about it. Found myself out of excuses and therefore decided to go ahead and try it out only knowing that I wanted something ruby based. After some research and too much what can only be referred to as too much browsing it came down to Jekyll, Nanoc or Octopress...well I guess strictly speaking Nanoc versus Octopress and jekyll. Nanoc promised versatility but didn't provide a clear path to deployment. Jekyll and Octopress were both geared towards blogging provided a much clearer path to deployment via github and/or heroku which is a huge plus.

So here are go, taking the beautiful rough ride and planning to experience new tech as I have always done, via trial and error. Hoping to, by the end of it all have blogs running under their respect subdomains.
